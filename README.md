# Hands-On Reactive Programming with Python

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Reactive Programming with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-reactive-programming-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789138726), published by Packt.

**A comprehensive guide to help you understand the principles of Reactive and asynchronous programming and its benefits**

## About this repository

The master branch of this repository contains code that has been updated to work
with rxpy v3 and cyclotron v1. The code originally published with the book is
available on the
[ed1/rxpy1](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Reactive-Programming-with-Python/tree/ed1/rxpy1)
branch.

## What is this book about?
Reactive programming is central to many concurrent systems, but itâ€™s famous for
its steep learning curve, which makes most developers feel like they're hitting
a wall. With this book, you will get to grips with reactive programming by
steadily exploring various concepts

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Structure Python code for better readability, testing, and performance 
* Explore the world of event-based programming 
* Grasp the use of the most common operators in Rx 
* Understand reactive extensions beyond simple examples 
* Master the art of writing reusable components 
Deploy an application on a cloud platform with Docker and Traefik

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
rx.from_(...).pipe(
    ops.filter(),
    ops.distinct(),
    ops.take(20),
    ops.map(...),
)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is intended for software developers who are already at ease with
Python and have heard about reactive programming but have not had a chance to
work with it yet. However, no expertise is needed beyond that. Each chapter of
the book describes new notions step by step so that the reader can gradually
gain the necessary knowledge to understand the chapters that follow.

Hopefully, this will not be a read once and put on the shelf book. The operators
documentation and descriptions of ways to tackle common problems should make
this book regularly handy, even after being fully read.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present
in the book (Chapter 1-12).

### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |

**Romain Picard**
is currently a data science engineer. He has been working in the digital TV and
telecommunications industry for 20 years. His daily work consists of data
manipulation, machine learning model training, and model deployment. Almost all
of these tasks are based on Python code, and he uses reactive programming
whenever it's applicable. He was previously a media software architect and a
software developer. In these previous positions, he designed and developed TV
and OTT players that have been used in tens of millions of set top boxes. Romain
is especially interested in algorithms, looking for the most suitable algorithm
for each use case.
